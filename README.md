ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @jacksonvanv !

Iâ€™m interested in pursuing an internship in product management.  This past summer, I was a PM intern at an enterprise software company, where I had the opportunity to create feature proposals, conduct customer research, prototype, and write user requirements.

This is a collection of personal projects I'm working on. My most current project is Wing Watch, a live flight tracker: https://jacksonvanv.github.io/wingwatch/
