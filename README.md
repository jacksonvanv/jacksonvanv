### Welcome!

Hi, Iâ€™m Jackson! ðŸ‘‹ 

Iâ€™m interested in associate/rotational product management roles starting summer 2025. I am currently a senior at the University of Chicago studying math and economics.

#### Some past experience

This past summer, I was an analytics intern for an internal risk product at Capital One, where I had the opportunity to analyze data from financial crimes investigations to inform the development of a new anti-money laundering machine learning model.

The prior summer, I was a PM intern at ClickTime, an enterprise software company, and got to develop a roadmap for the company's expense entry/approval module. I gained experience with conducting customer interviews, writing user requirements, and collaborating with design and engineering to start building out my feature proposals.

After experience on both the analytics side and a more classic PM role, I feel that a product management role better aligns with my career desires and goals. From my PM internship, I truly enjoyed the collaboration and ability to work end-to-end, interacting with users and create impact for both customers and the company. I am confident that my analytics skills will make me a better PM, as I've learned to effectively leverage data to drive decision-making.

#### My projects

This Github is a collection of personal projects I'm working on. As a math/economics major, I recognize that I might not have as much programming experience as most pure computer science majors. Though I've taken multiple CS courses, I wanted to showcase some of my recent coding work. All these projects are ideated, designed, and developed entirely by me. I have some more work from courses at UChicago that I am happy to share upon request!
